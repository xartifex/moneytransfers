# Java/Scala Test
Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money
transfers between internal users/accounts.
### Explicit requirements:
1 - keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is invoked
by another internal system/service)
2 - use whatever frameworks/libraries you like (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the requirement
\#1
3 - the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test
4 - the final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a pre-installed
container/server)
5 - demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected
### Implicit requirements:
1 - the code produced by you is expected to be of good quality.
2 - there are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
Please put your work on github or bitbucket.
